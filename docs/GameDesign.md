# Game Design

- affinity or attuning main theme? instead of classes you say you are fire attuned or lightning attuned or blade or whatever\
- Adventurer - Attuned

- you are a regular person in an adventurer's guild in some small town
- cull dungeons locally to prevent overflow 
- each dungeon has its own specialized loot like realm whites
- what you do impacts how you gain new abilities every level

- humanity is in a golden age essentially, most of the world has been civilized
- still dangerous outside of cities but not too bad on roads
- closer to capital = nicer and more powerful, a lot of adventurers want to move inwards

- skills = spells = patterns
- gain from books, repeated actions, lucky chances, random on level ups
- initially need to master spells by "weaving" minigame then can use on keypress
- possibly allow weaving without any guidance to try to discover spells on your own?

- your skills have a hidden power rating that is a measure of how deep your understanding of it is
- increase by using frequently, potions, lucky chances, etc

- skills have bottlenecks at certain level markers
- to get past need to find some rare consumable or some interaction of the skill with something else
- the manner you progress past the bottleneck affects power rating

- player also faces bottlenecks as they level 
- need elixirs 
- as you cast spells an orb in the middle of the UI fills up with the mana types you are using
- you get notifications like in azarinth healer that store up you can scroll through for kills

- starting the game places you in an adventurer's guild signing up to be an adventurer
- you are given one basic pieces of gear of your choice (sword, bow, etc) and one pattern (identify, fire bolt, poison weapon, etc)

- dungeons are procedurally generated similar to rotmg but bigger

- level ups cause a bunch of like golden energy to stream into you like system energy
